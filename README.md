  This mod adds to Mindustry some chess things, such as moves accuracy, chess pieces, and other Chess.com* icons.
Moves accuracy will be added as effects when I will know how to do so and I will create NOT bugged sprites.
I'm not an expert informaticien, but I managed to create a couple of working Mindustry mods.
If you like the mod, however, why not leaving a star on GitHub?  It would help me understanding what type of mods people like more.
--------  
This mod is still in development, for any bug notice DM me on Instagram: @alright_that_is_chess.

  *No copyright infringement intended. For legal questions about that, write to me on Github or using other info I posted in my README profile file.
I will solve the issues within 7 days, even during holidays; also, if the issue is the mod itself, I will delete it.
